Task #1 + Errors we've encountered:

We were unable to run the first .py file. To remedy this, we were required to install several modules, including...
- pip3 install numpy

Next, we noticed the file was still not running. Upon debugging, we noticed that the line:
from . import assoc_utils_np as assoc_utils

Is incorrect, and needs to be replaced with: 
import assoc_utils_np as assoc_utils

Now that we run that, we still encounter this error:
on % /usr/local/bin/python3 /Users/chris/VectorHaSH/ICSI445-AI-Neu
roscience-Final-Presentation/src/assoc_utils_np_2D.py

We are not sure how to fix it, and we cannot progress from here until we do.
